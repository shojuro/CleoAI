# CleoAI Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

This report identifies critical security vulnerabilities and production readiness issues in the CleoAI codebase. Several high-priority issues need to be addressed before production deployment.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials and Secrets

**Severity: CRITICAL**

- **docker-compose.yml (lines 88-89)**: Hardcoded MongoDB Express credentials
  ```yaml
  ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME=admin
  ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD=admin
  ```
- **docker-compose.yml (line 54)**: Hardcoded PostgreSQL password in comments
  ```yaml
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=cleoai_password
  ```

**Recommendation**: Remove all hardcoded credentials. Use environment variables or secrets management.

### 2. No Authentication/Authorization

**Severity: CRITICAL**

- The API has no authentication mechanism implemented
- GraphQL endpoints are completely open (api_router.py)
- No user identity verification in API calls
- JWT configuration exists but is disabled (`enable_auth: bool = False`)

**Recommendation**: Implement JWT-based authentication before production deployment.

### 3. CORS Security

**Severity: HIGH**

- **api_router.py (line 43)**: CORS allows all origins by default
  ```python
  cors_origins = ["*"]  # Allow all origins in development
  ```

**Recommendation**: Configure specific allowed origins for production.

### 4. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

**Severity: HIGH**

- **supabase_service.py (lines 420-422)**: String interpolation in queries
  ```python
  f"title.ilike.%{text_query}%,"
  f"content.ilike.%{text_query}%"
  ```

**Recommendation**: Use parameterized queries or proper query builders.

### 5. Sensitive Data in Logs

**Severity: MEDIUM**

- Error handling logs full exception details including context (error_handling.py)
- No sanitization of sensitive data in logs
- Health check endpoints expose system information

**Recommendation**: Implement log sanitization and reduce verbosity in production.

### 6. Docker Security Issues

**Severity: MEDIUM**

- Redis and MongoDB exposed on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- No network segmentation between services
- Admin tools (Redis Commander, Mongo Express) included in production compose

**Recommendation**: Use internal networks and remove admin tools from production.

### 7. Input Validation

**Severity: MEDIUM**

- Limited input validation in inference engine
- No rate limiting on API endpoints
- No request size limits
- GraphQL introspection enabled in production

**Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive input validation and rate limiting.

### 8. Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Severity: MEDIUM**

Several dependencies may have known vulnerabilities:
- redis==5.0.1
- pymongo==4.6.1
- fastapi==0.109.0

**Recommendation**: Run dependency vulnerability scan and update packages.

### 9. Memory System Access Control

**Severity: MEDIUM**

- No access control between users' memory data
- User ID validation relies on client-provided values
- No encryption for sensitive memory data

**Recommendation**: Implement proper access control and data isolation.

### 10. Error Information Leakage

**Severity: LOW**

- Detailed error messages exposed to clients
- Stack traces visible in API responses
- System paths exposed in error messages

**Recommendation**: Implement production error handling that sanitizes output.

## Additional Security Concerns

### Environment Configuration
- .env file contains development settings but no production template
- Secrets loaded directly from environment without validation
- No secret rotation mechanism

### API Security
- GraphQL playground enabled by default
- No query complexity limits
- No request throttling

### Data Protection
- No encryption at rest for sensitive data
- No data retention policies enforced
- No audit logging for data access

## Recommended Security Improvements

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)
1. Implement authentication and authorization
2. Remove all hardcoded credentials
3. Configure CORS properly
4. Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities
5. Disable GraphQL introspection
6. Implement rate limiting

### Short-term Improvements
1. Add input validation middleware
2. Implement proper logging with sanitization
3. Set up network segmentation in Docker
4. Add security headers to API responses
5. Implement session management
6. Set up dependency vulnerability scanning

### Long-term Security Enhancements
1. Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
2. Add comprehensive audit logging
3. Set up intrusion detection
4. Implement security monitoring and alerting
5. Regular security assessments
6. Implement secret rotation

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Remove all hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication
- [ ] Configure CORS for specific domains
- [ ] Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Disable debug mode and introspection
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Configure proper logging
- [ ] Set up network segmentation
- [ ] Remove development tools from Docker
- [ ] Scan and update dependencies
- [ ] Implement access control for memory system
- [ ] Add security headers

- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting

## Conclusion

The CleoAI codebase has several critical security issues that must be addressed before production deployment. The most critical issues are the lack of authentication, hardcoded credentials, and SQL injection vulnerabilities. A comprehensive security review and implementation of the recommended fixes is essential for production readiness.
