## Acceptance Criteria for Production

Before deploying to production, ensure:

âœ… All CRITICAL and HIGH priority security issues are resolved
âœ… Authentication and authorization are fully implemented
âœ… Monitoring and alerting are operational
âœ… Database backups are automated and tested
âœ… Disaster recovery procedures are documented and tested
âœ… API has >80% test coverage
âœ… Load testing shows system can handle expected traffic
âœ… All dependencies are up-to-date with no critical vulnerabilities
âœ… Operational runbooks are complete
âœ… Security audit has been performed

## Notes

1. **Security First**: Address all critical security issues before any other work
2. **Iterative Approach**: Deploy to staging environment after each major milestone
3. **Testing**: Every change should include appropriate tests
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are implemented
5. **Code Review**: All changes must go through PR review process
