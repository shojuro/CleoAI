## Test Execution

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run security tests only
python -m pytest tests/security/ -v

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/security/test_authentication.py -v
```
